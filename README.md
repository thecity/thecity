A Ruby interface to the The City API. For more information about The City platform, see [http://api.onthecity.org][api info]

[api info]: http://api.onthecity.org

## Installation
    gem install thecity

## Configuration
The City API requires you to authenticate via OAuth, so you'll need to
register your application with The City under the Admin | API panel.

Your new application will be assigned a key/secret pair (app_id/app_secret). You'll need
to configure these values before you make a request or else you'll get the
error:

    Bad Authentication data

You can pass configuration options as a block to `TheCity::API::Client.new`.

```ruby
client = TheCity::API::Client.new do |config|
  config.app_id        = "YOUR_APP_ID"
  config.app_secret    = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
  config.access_token  = "OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN"
end
```

or

```ruby
client = TheCity::API::Client.new
client.app_id        = "YOUR_APP_ID"
client.app_secret    = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
client.access_token  = "OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Alternately, you can set the following environment variables:

    THECITY_APP_ID
    THECITY_APP_SECRET
    THECITY_ACCESS_TOKEN
    THECITY_SUBDOMAIN

## Usage Examples
All examples require an authenticated TheCity client with a valid access_token. See the section on <a
href="#configuration">configuration</a>.

After configuration, requests can be made like so:

**Get the authenticated user (current user)**

```ruby
client.me
```
**Post a topic**

```ruby
client.post_topic(:group_id => 1234567, :title => 'Mr. Watson, come here', :body => 'I want to see you.')
```
**Fetch the groups the current user belongs to**

```ruby
client.my_groups
```

For more usage examples, please see the full [documentation][].

## Advanced Configuration

### Middleware
The Faraday middleware stack is fully configurable and is exposed as a
`Faraday::Builder` object. You can modify the default middleware in-place:

```ruby
client.middleware.insert_after TheCity::Response::RaiseError, CustomMiddleware
```

A custom adapter may be set as part of a custom middleware stack:

```ruby
client.middleware = Faraday::Builder.new(
  &Proc.new do |builder|
    # Specify a middleware stack here
    builder.adapter :some_other_adapter
  end
)
```
